# Video Lectures on TLAPlus

## By Leslie Lamport

```
This is a work in progress that consists of the beginning of a series of video lectures to teach programmers and software engineers
how to write their own TLA+ specifications.

```
Leslie Lamport inventor of Paxos and developer of LaTeX introduces techniques and tools that help programmers 
think above the code level to determine what applications and services should do and ensure that they do it. 
Depending on the task, the appropriate tools can range from simple prose to formal, tool-checked models written in TLA+ or PlusCal.

```
Architects draw detailed blueprints before a brick is laid or a nail is hammered. 
Programmers and software engineers seldom do. A blueprint for software is called a specification. 
The need for extremely rigorous specifications before coding complex or critical systems should be obvious,
especially for concurrent and distributed systems. 
This talk explains why some sort of specification should be written for any software.

Architects draw detailed plans before construction begins. Software engineers do not. 
Can this be why buildings seldom collapse and programs often crash?

A blueprint for software is called a specification. TLA+ specifications have been described as exhaustively testable pseudo-code. 
High-level TLA+ specifications can catch design errors that are now found only by examining the rubble after a system has collapsed.
